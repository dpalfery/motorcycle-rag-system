# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Motorcycle RAG System is an AI-powered information retrieval system that intelligently searches across multiple data sources including CSV specifications, PDF manuals, and web sources. The system leverages Azure AI Foundry's multi-agent architecture to provide comprehensive motorcycle information through a unified C# application. The system implements a sequential search pattern (Vector DB → Web Augmentation → PDF Fallback) to deliver accurate, contextual responses about motorcycle specifications, maintenance procedures, and technical documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a motorcycle enthusiast, I want to query motorcycle specifications and technical information, so that I can get comprehensive answers from multiple authoritative sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a motorcycle-related query THEN the system SHALL process the query through vector search in the primary database
2. WHEN the initial vector search provides insufficient results THEN the system SHALL augment with web sources for additional context
3. WHEN both vector and web searches are insufficient THEN the system SHALL fall back to detailed PDF manual search
4. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL return a unified response combining information from all relevant sources
5. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL provide a clear message indicating no results were found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to process and index motorcycle data from CSV files, so that structured specification data is searchable through the RAG system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV files containing motorcycle specifications are uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse files with up to 100 columns using delimitedText parsing mode
2. WHEN processing CSV data THEN the system SHALL implement row-based chunking to preserve relational integrity between specifications
3. WHEN CSV data is processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model
4. WHEN CSV processing is complete THEN the system SHALL index the data in Azure AI Search with proper metadata
5. IF CSV files contain headers THEN the system SHALL automatically map fields using firstLineContainsHeaders configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mechanic, I want to search through PDF maintenance manuals, so that I can find specific procedures and technical documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF manuals are uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text using Azure Document Intelligence's Layout model
2. WHEN processing PDF content THEN the system SHALL preserve document structure including tables and hierarchical sections
3. WHEN PDF contains images or diagrams THEN the system SHALL process multimodal content using GPT-4 Vision
4. WHEN PDF processing is complete THEN the system SHALL implement semantic chunking with embedding-based boundary detection
5. WHEN PDF content is indexed THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata including source document, section, and page references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use multi-agent architecture, so that complex queries can be handled through specialized agent coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a complex query THEN it SHALL use GPT-4o for conversation analysis and query planning
2. WHEN query planning is complete THEN the system SHALL break complex queries into focused subqueries
3. WHEN subqueries are generated THEN the system SHALL execute parallel searches across different data sources
4. WHEN multiple search results are available THEN the system SHALL apply semantic ranking for result fusion
5. WHEN agent coordination is required THEN the system SHALL use Semantic Kernel Agent Framework for orchestration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to be deployed on Azure with proper authentication and monitoring, so that it operates securely and reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Azure AI Foundry as the primary platform
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use managed identity with DefaultAzureCredential
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL implement retry policies with exponential backoff
4. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN system events occur THEN they SHALL be logged to Application Insights for monitoring
6. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL use Azure Container Apps for scalable orchestration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious stakeholder, I want the system to optimize resource usage, so that operational costs remain within budget while maintaining performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4o-mini for standard chat completion to optimize costs
2. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL implement query caching for common motorcycle information requests
3. WHEN batch processing is possible THEN the system SHALL process 100-1000 documents per batch for efficiency
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL implement vector compression for storage efficiency
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL integrate with Azure Cost Management for tracking and alerts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide reliable responses, so that users receive consistent service quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure OpenAI rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN search operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to alternative data sources
3. WHEN invalid queries are submitted THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages
4. WHEN system components are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully with partial functionality
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
