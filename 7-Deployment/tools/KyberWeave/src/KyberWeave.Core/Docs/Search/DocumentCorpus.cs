/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This exists because term frequency alone ranks badly on a corpus that is entirely
/// about one system. "user", "authentication", "api" and "session" appear in nearly every
/// document here, so under plain term-frequency cosine they contribute as much evidence
/// as a rare, decisive term — and the documents densest in that shared vocabulary win
/// regardless of what was asked. A plainly-worded question ("why does the user keep
/// getting logged out") returned three requirements documents and never surfaced the
/// troubleshooting runbook that answers it verbatim.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Rarity is measured across the corpus and folded into scoring with Okapi BM25, so a
/// term shared by seventy documents counts for almost nothing while a term appearing in
/// three counts for a great deal.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The statistics deliberately live here rather than in <see cref="TextVectorizer"/>.
/// That type is stateless and shared with skill routing and agent drift detection, which
/// compare two texts to each other with no corpus in view; giving it corpus awareness
/// would silently change what those linters report.
